TESTER'S DIGEST
===============
ISSUE #23 - July 9, 2017

Testing doesn't put quality into software, it only shines the light on the good, bad and ugly that's already present therein. To build higher quality software, consider applying specific best practices at the stages of design and development. This issue looks at code review. We will get to static code analysis next week.

Topic: Code Review
==================

Praise for code review as a process from two different ex-Googler:

A lighthearted take on the wrong ways to do code review, both as the reviewer, and the author of the code up for review:

Advice on improving code review practices from Asana (team collaboration SaaS). I liked the step where reviewer runs the app from the branch under review to help them understand what the change does, and possibly find bugs.

Code review practices at Atlassian (circa 2010): it's not a bug hunt, and it's not a blame game. They regard code review as an embodiment of the 1st principle of the Agile Manifesto: "Individuals and interactions over processes and tools", and see improved code quality as a nice side effect.

This post opens with a code review template used at Server Density (monitoring SaaS provider) and touches on the testing aspect, both unit tests and manual testing of a pull request.
