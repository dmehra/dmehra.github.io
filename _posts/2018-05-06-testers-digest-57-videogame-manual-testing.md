TESTER'S DIGEST
===============
ISSUE #57 - May 6, 2018

Manual testing of video games is not your dream job. In this issue we look at the manual QA, and next time we'll take on test automation for games.

Topic: Video Game Manual Testing
================================

Testers express their frustration at the tedium, pointlessness of working on game that never gets released, filing bugs that never get addressed, grueling schedule, low compensation, and lack of both respect and career growth. A pretty emotional post:

More confirmation of the same points here... and apparently, there was a TV reality show, The Tester, about QA'ing Sony PlayStation.

This post adds reflection on the organizational setup and QA process at game companies, with good insights into tester's job being not so much finding bugs as reproducing them, explanation of triage process, and compliance testing.
