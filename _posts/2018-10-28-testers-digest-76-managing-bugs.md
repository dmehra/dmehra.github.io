TESTER'S DIGEST
===============
ISSUE #76 - October 28, 2018

Apropos the upcoming Halloween, our scary topic today is bugs and how to deal with them: from writing bug reports and reporting duplicates to dealing with defect clustering and deciding what percentage of bugs to address.

Topic: Managing Bugs
====================

On viewing bug reports as "quality offers" whose aim is to improve quality of the product -- which, of course, is the whole point of filing bugs, but this post suggests a positive way of thinking and writing:

When should bugs be reported individually even if they seem to have the same root cause, and could therefore be called duplicates?

On defect clustering and how to turn it from a problem into a solution:

Decent intro to writing a bug report. Sadly, examples are only for login, which I tend to view as too simple to be insightful, but gotta start somewhere.
