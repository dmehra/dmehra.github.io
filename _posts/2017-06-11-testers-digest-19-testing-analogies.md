TESTER'S DIGEST
===============
ISSUE #19 - June 11, 2017

Quality and testing subjects are sometimes best explained through the use of analogies. Similes, metaphors and bad puns can work too. This issue of Tester's Digest offers a compilation of all of the above... even koans.

Topic: Testing Analogies

Technical terms explained via analogies: "2-factor authentication is like Cinderella's slipper"

Off-Topic

I suppose this is not entirely off topic, since visualization is a kind of analogy. How to visually indicate broken builds or alerts by hanging these UFO looking lights throughout your office:
