TESTER'S DIGEST
===============
ISSUE #48 - February 25, 2018

Tester's Digest is back after a flu break. We look at the classical QA task of load testing, with some modern twists - should developers do it? should you load test in production? how can it all go wrong?

Topic: Load Testing
===================

Should developers write their own load tests, rather than have QA or another team do it for them? This post votes yes:

How you can write load tests wrong: 1) make them too short; 2) ignore anomalies; 3) reuse test data (or rather, fail to disable caching); 4) only load test under happy path conditions with no failures.

Additional uses of load tests: to help reproduce a sporadic performance issue, or to uncover app slowness based on user's location.

Worth learning: Introduction to distributed systems. Per Lamport, 1987, "A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn't even know existed can render your own computer unusable". These days, there is no other kind of systems...
