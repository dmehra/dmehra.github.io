Let's take a look at exploratory testing which is said to be the most valuable manual testing activity. In the off-topic section you will find a few amusing bugs.

Topic: Exploratory Testing
==========================

What exploratory testing is and how to do it well:

Exploratory testing explained by James Bach:

A comprehensive 180-slide tutorial by Cem Kaner from 2008, still relevant:

What if you don't want to test like it's 2008? Outsourcing is pass√©, crowdsourcing is in vogue now. This case study describes how Poll Everywhere crowdsourced their exploratory testing via RainforestQA service:

Three reasons to do exploratory testing: it finds bugs, bugs, and bugs.

One team runs an experiment in testing a new feature via exploratory methods vs scripted tests (i.e. pre-planned manual tests), finds that 25% of bugs found with ET would not have been detected with their usual ST. I thought the use of a mind map for directing ET was an interesting idea.

Examples of testing tours used in exploratory testing (of a car selling website https://www.lingscars.com/ which is correctly described as "deeply insane").

Puzzles that aim to teach exploratory testing techniques. The goal is to figure out the system's logic by playing with it.

Off-Topic
=========

To follow last week's fun email bugs, here are a few more amusing bug stories.

Story of an "unfixable" bug. You may guess the ending early on... or not:
