TESTER'S DIGEST
===============
ISSUE #56 - April 29, 2018

What skills befit a modern software tester? We examine domain expertise, data-driven testing, technical skills, DevOps skillset, UX aspect, and pair testing.

Topic: Tester Skills
====================

How QA fits with DevOps: the idea of lean QA or "QA Ops" entails looking at the whole system with the eye to continuous improvement. QA Ops would assist with things such as Test Driven Infrastructure, defining metrics, and building tools for monitoring, and more generally "add intelligence, curiosity and out of the box thinking and exploration".
